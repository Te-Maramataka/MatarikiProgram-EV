# Contributing Guide

## Welcome to the contributing guide
Here we'll explain how to get started contributing to the project, and what to expect.

## Tools we use
* Visual Studio Code - Preferred editor (optional)
* yarn - Preferred package manager (if you prefer npm, be sure to delete the yarn.lock file)
* nodemon - For development
* tsc - TypeScript compiler
* git - CLI for managing Git repositories

## Syntax conventions
We use a list of preferred syntax conventions for code reability:

* Comments
* Double quotes
* Semi-colons
* Tab indentations

Consistency in syntax also improves code reability.

## Getting started

If your pull request gets accepted, great, good job! If it doesn't, review the comments provided and either alter the pull request or remove it.
